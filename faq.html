        <h1>Freqently Asked Questions</h1>

        <p>
          <span class="question">What are your hours?</span>We are open
          7:30pm-11pm every Friday and Saturday in the month of October.
          Additionally we will be open Sunday the 29th before Halloween and
          Saturday 11/4.  Please see the Calendar here for exact dates:

        </div>

        <p>
          <span class="question">Can I buy tickets in advance?</span>Yes.
          Purchasing tickets online and in advance is highly recommended and the
          only way to guarantee entry upon your arrival at Nightmare Realm.
          Walk-up sales are subject to availability depending on volume of
          online sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Where do I need to be to enter into the show?</span
          >To experience a night at Nightmare Realm you will want to head to Paw
          Paw High School to board the bus. Please do not arrive more than 15-20
          minutes early.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >"My ticket says 7:30pm on it, does that mean I have to be there at
            7:30pm?"</span
          >No. The 7:30pm just means Nightmare Realm starts its buses on
          rotation at 7:30pm. We do not have timed ticketing for the 2022
          season, so you can arrive any time between 7:30pm and 11pm and get
          into the attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Does Nightmare Realm accept credit cards?</span
          >Yes, we take Visa and Mastercard.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Does Nightmare Realm accept cash?</span>Yes,
          on-site in the parking lot we do accept cash.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >I just bought my ticket online…do I still have to wait in line when
            I get to the Haunted House?</span
          >Unless you bought VIP passes, which get you speed entry onto the bus
          and into the attraction, General Admission passes will have a wait
          time when you get to the haunted house. To make all wait times more
          entertaining and horrifying for our guests we do have Creatures from
          the Realm in our parking lot, on our buses, and in our midway and
          Queue areas. This ensures more of a terrifyingly fun experience all
          around.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Are the monsters allowed to touch you?</span
          >No, the monsters within the attraction will not touch you. Cid on the
          other hand....
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Are there any age restrictions?</span>Nightmare
          Realm is recommended for ages 13 years and older. This is because of
          gore and intense situations. We have had many guests under the age of
          10 visit us and have a great time. With that being said we have had
          many adults leave crying. It is all up to the guardians discretion on
          if they think their minor can handle horror. Anyone younger than 16
          years old <em>NEEDS</em> a guardian or responsible party to ride the
          bus with them. There are no special prices for minors and no refunds
          if anyone decides not to finish the haunt. There are many emergency
          exits throughout each attraction in case anyone gets too scared to
          continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >If my child wants to go into the attraction do I have to go as
            well?</span
          >If your child is over the age of 13 they are welcome to come to the
          attraction and experience the show with a paid ticket. As a guardian
          not desiring to experience the show we offer you a free ride on our
          bus and free entry into our midway to relax and enjoy some horror
          movie clips, or some food if you choose to purchase it until your
          party is finished with their walk through.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Is there a lot of smoke in the haunted house?</span
          >We do use fog machines at Nightmare Realm. Should you find the smoke
          too intense there are emergency exits throughout the attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Are there strobe lights?</span>Yes, we do use
          strobe lights occasionally. We do not recommend anyone with
          sensitivity to bright strobe lights, loud noises, or intense scents to
          enter Nightmare Realm presents Retribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Once we've used our ticket can we go through again with the same
            ticket?</span
          >No. But a "Go Again" pass can be purchased at our concession stand,
          that will allow our customers to go through a second time, entering
          through the VIP line for only $10.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Can we be thrown out of the park for any reason?</span
          >Yes. We do not allow foul language, pushing, vulgar behavior, weapons
          of any kind, alcohol, etc. We have a list of rules just like anyone
          else that must be adhered to for your own safety. Those in violation
          of these rules may be asked to modify their behavior or leave the
          property without a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Do you serve alcoholic beverages? </span>NO!
          And they are not allowed on the property, so please do not bring any.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Is smoking allowed?</span>Smoking and Vaping
          are only allowed in the parking lot and outside of the General
          Attraction Area (right where the bus drops you off and where the bus
          picks you up). Smoking and Vaping are NOT allowed within the
          attraction, either indoors or outdoors, in the queue lines or midways.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Can we take flash photos of your haunted houses?</span
          >No photography of any sort is allowed in the haunts. Haunted houses
          are dark and people's eyes (especially the actors/actresses) adjust to
          the low light. When you flash your camera you're not only ruining
          other customers' experience but you're hurting the actors' eyes.
          Although no photography or videotaping is allowed inside (including
          nightshot), the monsters working outside will quite often pose for
          pictures. Nightmare Realm also has 3 selfie stations themed with
          different elements from our show for you to enjoy taking pics at.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >What can't we bring with us inside your haunted houses?</span
          ><em></em>No pets! No weapons! No alcoholic beverages! No cameras! No
          smoking! No vaping! No laser pointers or flashlights! No food or
          beverages!
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Do you sell beverages and souvenirs at your attractions?</span
          >Yes. We sell souvenirs at our gift shop including t-shirts,
          sweatshirts, hats, patches, and more. Our midway features a concession
          stand with pizza from Erbelli's Pizzeria, cider and donuts from
          VerHage's Cider Mill &amp; Bakery, Coffee from Biggby, snack packs
          from Blonda's Cooking, and assorted candy bars.

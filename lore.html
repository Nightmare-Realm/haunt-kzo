        <h1>The Nightmare Realm</h1>
        <p>
          Far back in time, a flash of light erupted which quickly faded into
          everlasting darkness...
        </p>
        <p>
          A world parallel to ours exists. A place of unimaginable horrors based
          in a landscape that is constantly adapting and evolving. Within this
          harsh atmosphere there lives ancient beings. Creatures that have
          learned to harness the power of their ever-changing world and use it
          for their most basic need, survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Food in this world was a scarce resource to find, so the Aedifex and
          Sedibus searched without and within to find a means to feed. It was
          only by accident that one of the elders found a telepathic connection
          to another being, one that was meek and easy to influence. This beings
          reaction to the Aedifex was one of pure fear, and after the meeting
          the creature had felt something it had never before, fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>
          While practicing and honing its skill the Aedifex learned more about
          the beings it was using. They called themselves "humans" and they were
          most vulnerable when they had the least self control, within sleep.
          The Aedifax utilized its ability to adapt by altering its image and
          forcing the humans to perceive their true fears. In another world
          these experiences were deemed "Nightmares" but within the Realm it was
          called the Feeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time went on the Aedifex became the creators, the architects that
          forged the ideas and atmospheres during the Feedings. For the fear of
          the humans was one that was ever evolving, just as the creatures of
          the Realm and their world. The Aedifex used these times to learn what
          they would need to feed, how to create the perfect Event. The Sedibus
          were the ones who brought the Events to life. They brought the spark
          of darkness that began the Feedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Feedings went on for ages, until one day an Aedifex created a new
          kind of connection. A connection that was so strong, the creatures of
          the Realm were pulled into the new world. Now face to face with the
          beings they had fed off for so long it awoke something evil within the
          creatures. Their worlds were now connected and the Aedifex knew just
          how to this time. Pulling parts of their own world through the portal,
          they were able to change the environment of the humans, creating a
          real world nightmare state unlike anything ever seen. The humans fear
          was exquisite. Death, torture, and chaos. It became known as "The
          Feast."
        </p>
        <p>
          The first Feast only existed for fleeting moments, but the creatures
          wanted more. Vowing to open the portal once again, the Aedifex
          continued to search for the perfect connection. Over time these Feasts
          were scattered, but a pattern began to form. The "Extinction Events,"
          which humans called them, started to become more frequent and more
          deadly with every visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only a matter of time until the creatures found a way to
          sustain the portal and truly unleash the terror on humanity they
          desired to feed.

        <h1>Extinction Event #16:</h1>
        <h2>"Retribution"</h2>
        <p>
          Cypress Hollow was one of those small towns. A place that was so close
          to being rural, but was so dangerously suburban. Where you could smell
          the burning of leaves, while simultaneously inhaling the scent of
          Pumpkin Spice Lattes. A place where exterior exploration once ruled
          supreme, but has now been overthrown by a character on the screen and
          a controller in hand. Where mothers hovered, and fathers kept watch on
          the grill. A place that Trista could never call her true home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although an ordinary girl in every way, there was one thing that made
          Trista extraordinary... the voices. A different place, maybe a
          different time, she would have been respected, even revered for her
          abilities. But in Cypress Hollow it caused her nothing but pain and
          torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since she was young, Trista could hear the voices of something unknown
          to her. When she told her parents of these strange sounds that no one
          else could hear they took her to the town doctor. After many days of
          testing and all the drugs he could throw at her it was determined that
          her "voices" were a fragment of her imagination and that she was too
          old for playing these games. Continually growing in their intensity,
          the voices made it harder and harder to focus at school.The students
          and faculty who once worried for her, now had grown disdain for Trista
          and herbizarre ways. As time passed, disdain became hatred as it often
          does, which spread throughoutthe town like a disease. An infection,
          that even touched the parents that once loved and onlywanted to help
          their sweet daughter. Only few remained who saw the true girl within,
          but theywere not enough to silence the masses.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was now a "Freak" to the rest of them. An outcast with nowhere to
          go. Until one day she realized she could turn inward. A world of
          darkness filled with the voices that have always been there. Once
          there to torment her, she now saw them as a comfort. Over time she was
          able to understand their language. Silently she was able to be an
          observer within their society, she felt connected. This connection
          grew until she finally broke her silence. Trista had somehow created a
          telepathic bridge between herself and the Aedifex allowing her to
          communicate with these creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          From then on she lived her daily life in our world, while consciously
          existing in their realm. She had finally found the balance within her
          life that she had never experienced before, until the scale was
          tipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          While returning home from the library one day Trista was approached by
          some of the kids from school. They had come up with a hoax to scare
          her by taking her to the old industrial center and tying her up to a
          noose. It was never meant to go too far in most of their minds, it was
          just a joke after all. But one girl decided it was time to teach
          Trista a lesson, and kicked Trista off the ledge. While hanging there
          Trista's consciousness escaped her shell of a body into the Realm,
          creating a portal from their world to ours. Extinction Event #16 was
          recorded to have begun this day, October 23rd, 1993.

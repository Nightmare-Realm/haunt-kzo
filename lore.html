          Far back in time, a flash of light erupted which quickly faded into
          everlasting darkness...<br />‍<br />A world parallel to ours exists. A
          place of unimaginable horrors based in a landscape that is constantly
          adapting and evolving. Within this harsh atmosphere there lives
          ancient beings. Creatures that have learned to harness the power of
          their ever-changing world and use it for their most basic need,
          survival.<br />‍<br />Food in this world was a scarce resource to
          find, so the Aedifex and Sedibus searched without and within to find a
          means to feed. It was only by accident that one of the elders found a
          telepathic connection to another being, one that was meek and easy to
          influence. This beings reaction to the Aedifex was one of pure fear,
          and after the meeting the creature had felt something it had never
          before, fulfillment.<br />‍<br />While practicing and honing its skill
          the Aedifex learned more about the beings it was using. They called
          themselves "humans" and they were most vulnerable when they had the
          least self control, within sleep. The Aedifax utilized its ability to
          adapt by altering its image and forcing the humans to perceive their
          true fears. In another world these experiences were deemed
          "Nightmares" but within the Realm it was called the Feeding.<br />‍<br />As
          time went on the Aedifex became the creators, the architects that
          forged the ideas and<br />atmospheres during the Feedings. For the
          fear of the humans was one that was ever evolving, just<br />as the
          creatures of the Realm and their world. The Aedifex used these times
          to learn what they<br />would need to feed, how to create the perfect
          Event. The Sedibus were the ones who brought the<br />Events to life.
          They brought the spark of darkness that began the Feedings.<br />‍<br />The
          Feedings went on for ages, until one day an Aedifex created a new kind
          of connection. A connection that was so strong, the creatures of the
          Realm were pulled into the new world. Now face to face with the beings
          they had fed off for so long it awoke something evil within the
          creatures. Their worlds were now connected and the Aedifex knew just
          how to this time. Pulling parts of their own world through the portal,
          they were able to change the environment of the humans, creating a
          real world nightmare state unlike anything ever seen. The humans fear
          was exquisite. Death, torture, and chaos. It became known as "The
          Feast."<br />‍<br />The first Feast only existed for fleeting moments,
          but the creatures wanted more. Vowing to open the portal once again,
          the Aedifex continued to search for the perfect connection. Over time
          these Feasts were scattered, but a pattern began to form. The
          "Extinction Events," which humans called them, started to become more
          frequent and more deadly with every visit.<br />‍<br />It was only a
          matter of time until the creatures found a way to sustain the portal
          and truly unleash<br />the terror on humanity they desired to feed.

          Cypress Hollow was one of those small towns. A place that was so
          close to being rural, but was so dangerously suburban. Where you could
          smell the burning of leaves, while simultaneously inhaling the scent
          of Pumpkin Spice Lattes. A place where exterior exploration once ruled
          supreme, but has now been overthrown by a character on the screen and
          a controller in hand. Where mothers hovered, and fathers kept watch on
          the grill. A place that Trista could never call her true home.<br />‍<br />Although
          an ordinary girl in every way, there was one thing that made Trista
          extraordinary... the voices. A different place, maybe a different
          time, she would have been respected, even revered for her abilities.
          But in Cypress Hollow it caused her nothing but pain and torment.<br />‍<br />Since
          she was young, Trista could hear the voices of something unknown to
          her. When she told her parents of these strange sounds that no one
          else could hear they took her to the town doctor. After many days of
          testing and all the drugs he could throw at her it was determined that
          her "voices" were a fragment of her imagination and that she was too
          old for playing these games. <br /><br />Continually growing in their
          intensity, the voices made it harder and harder to focus at school.<br />The
          students and faculty who once worried for her, now had grown disdain
          for Trista and her<br />bizarre ways. As time passed, disdain became
          hatred as it often does, which spread throughout<br />the town like a
          disease. An infection, that even touched the parents that once loved
          and only<br />wanted to help their sweet daughter. Only few remained
          who saw the true girl within, but they<br />were not enough to silence
          the masses.<br />‍<br />She was now a "Freak" to the rest of them. An
          outcast with nowhere to go. Until one day she realized she could turn
          inward. A world of darkness filled with the voices that have always
          been there. Once there to torment her, she now saw them as a comfort.
          Over time she was able to understand their language. Silently she was
          able to be an observer within their society, she felt connected. This
          connection grew until she finally broke her silence. Trista had
          somehow created a telepathic bridge between herself and the Aedifex
          allowing her to communicate with these creatures.<br />‍<br />From
          then on she lived her daily life in our world, while consciously
          existing in their realm. She had finally found the balance within her
          life that she had never experienced before, until the scale was
          tipped.<br />‍<br />While returning home from the library one day
          Trista was approached by some of the kids from school. They had come
          up with a hoax to scare her by taking her to the old industrial center
          and tying her up to a noose. It was never meant to go too far in most
          of their minds, it was just a joke after all. But one girl decided it
          was time to teach Trista a lesson, and kicked Trista off the ledge.
          While hanging there Trista's consciousness escaped her shell of a body
          into the Realm, creating a portal from their world to ours. Extinction
          Event #16 was recorded to have begun this day, October 23rd, 1993.<br />

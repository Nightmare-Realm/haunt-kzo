          to take part in, which will give us an idea of the characters you are
          able to play.

        </p>
        <p>
          The auditions are for all different roles in our haunted attraction.
          Embedded in an intense and immersive atmosphere, Nightmare Realm
          haunted attraction will deliver a storyline that is meant to leave our
          visitors shocked, horrified and all around entertained. We are looking
          to gather a group of artists and creatives that help to take our story
          and mold each character within it to create the best haunt possible.
          We are looking for people who want to have fun while taking this
          opportunity seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you like the idea of being in a workplace based on innovation and
          creativity, acting safely face-to-face with your audience, or getting
          paid to scare the S#!% out of people, send in that audition! The
          audition process is really a getting to know you event which is based
          around having fun. You do not need to prepare anything for your
          audition. Just make sure to wear comfortable clothes you can move
          around in, and be ready to have a good time. Nightmare Realm is ready
          to open its doors, are you ready to come inside and play?<br /><br />

        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Q: If I don't want to act, do I still need to come to
            auditions?</span
          >
          A: Audition day is also for interviews for the other available
          positions, just let us know what position you are applying for and we
          will tailor the interview accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Q: What age are you hiring?</span>
          A: Because of the aspects of the job we can only hire 16 years and
          older. There are restrictions on minors that do not allow them to stay
          as late as we are open during the season. We will still bring on
          minors as volunteers though.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Q: Volunteers...What is that about?</span>
          A: This year Nightmare Realm is opening up opportunities for volunteer
          positions. These positions are for anyone who cannot commit for a
          whole season schedule but want to give haunting a try. Although you
          will not be paid, you still get the experience and if you like we will
          put you on an employee first call list for later years.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Q: What is the pay rate?</span>
          A: The pay rates are to be determined, but will be above minimum wage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Q: What do I need to bring to the in-person auditions?</span
          >
          A: You will need to bring application info such as Social Security
          number, previous employer information, availability during haunt
          season (October 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27, 28, 29, Nov. 4, Dec. 8, 9),
          and a bottle of water is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Q: What should I wear during the audition?</span
          >
          A: Wear comfortable clothes and shoes that you can move around in
          during any improv games we may have you take part in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Q: What will I need to do?</span>
          A: You will audition by answering questions, doing improv games, etc.
          Additionally we will have you fill out a seasonal calendar with your
          availability to the best of your knowledge, and take a picture to add
          it to your application.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Q: Do I need prior acting experience?</span>
          A: It is always helpful to have experience but it is not at all
          necessary. Just a good attitude and a willingness to look silly is all
          you need to audition.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Q: What is the time commitment if I am hired?</span
          >
          A: Call time on haunt days will be 5:30pm until we close that night.
          The calendar you fill out will help us determine the days we will
          contract you to be working. There will also be scheduled training and
          safety days that are mandatory to attend. Please look above again if
          you need to see the calendar for days we will be open in the fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question">Q: What if I can’t be there by 5:30pm?</span>
          A: Some exceptions including work and school are fine but will need to
          be noted in your contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Q: Do I need to attend the training days and acting classes?</span
          >
          A: Yes! All training, rehearsal days, and safety meetings prepare you
          for opening day. We take all of this very seriously and want to make
          sure you are prepared! Training days cover all the information you
          need to make sure you, your coworkers, and the audience is safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="question"
            >Q: Will I know that day of my auditions if I have the job?</span
          >
          A: Not necessarily, we will have call backs and let you know when we
          have made our decisions.

          <strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong>
          </br></br>
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: If I don't want to act, do I still need to come to auditions?</strong></br>
          A: Audition day is also for interviews for the other available positions, just let us know what position you are applying for and we will tailor the interview accordingly.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: What age are you hiring?</strong></br>
          A: Because of the aspects of the job we can only hire 16 years and older. There are restrictions on minors that do not allow them to stay as late as we are open during the season. We will still bring on minors as volunteers though.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: Volunteers...What is that about?</strong></br>
          A: This year Nightmare Realm is opening up opportunities for volunteer positions. These positions are for anyone who cannot commit for a whole season schedule but want to give haunting a try. Although you will not be paid, you still get the experience and if you like we will put you on an employee first call list for later years.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: What is the pay rate?</strong></br>
          A: The pay rates are to be determined, but will be above minimum wage.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: What do I need to bring to the in-person auditions?</strong></br>
          A: You will need to bring application info such as Social Security number, previous employer information, availability during haunt season (October 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27, 28, 29, Nov. 4, Dec. 8, 9), and a bottle of water is recommended.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: What should I wear during the audition?</strong></br>
          A: Wear comfortable clothes and shoes that you can move around in during any improv games we may have you take part in.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: What will I need to do?</strong></br>
          A: You will audition by answering questions, doing improv games, etc. Additionally we will have you fill out a seasonal calendar with your availability to the best of your knowledge, and take a picture to add it to your application.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: Do I need prior acting experience?</strong></br>
          A: It is always helpful to have experience but it is not at all necessary. Just a good attitude and a willingness to look silly is all you need to audition.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: What is the time commitment if I am hired?</strong></br>
          A: Call time on haunt days will be 5:30pm until we close that night. The calendar you fill out will help us determine the days we will contract you to be working. There will also be scheduled training and safety days that are mandatory to attend. Please look above again if you need to see the calendar for days we will be open in the fall.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: What if I can’t be there by 5:30pm?</strong></br>
          A: Some exceptions including work and school are fine but will need to be noted in your contract.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: Do I need to attend the training days and acting classes?</strong></br>
          A: Yes! All training, rehearsal days, and safety meetings prepare you for opening day. We take all of this very seriously and want to make sure you are prepared! Training days cover all the information you need to make sure you, your coworkers, and the audience is safe.
          <br />‍<br />
          <strong class="bold-text-10">Q: Will I know that day of my auditions if I have the job?</strong></br>
          A: Not necessarily, we will have call backs and let you know when we have made our decisions.

        <span class="text-span">Acting Applications/Audition Process</span
        ><br />‍<br />This year Nightmare Realm will be holding Open Auditions
        on August 7th, 2022, anytime between 12pm-5pm. Our team will be
        accepting rolling auditions until August 31st.<br />‍<br />If you desire
        to audition please click the 'Apply Here' link to be taken to a page
        where you can fill out a simple application. If you want to work any of
        our other positions beyond acting please fill out an application as
        well, but when you come to the audition day you will not have to act. We
        will perform a standard interview at that time. <br />‍<br />The
        auditions are for all different roles in our haunted attraction.
        Embedded in an intense and immersive atmosphere, Nightmare Realm haunted
        attraction will deliver a storyline that is meant to leave our visitors
        shocked, horrified and all around entertained. We are looking to gather
        a group of artists and creatives that help to take our story and mold
        each character within it to create the best haunt possible. We are
        looking for people who want to have fun while taking this opportunity
        seriously.<br />‍<br />If you like the idea of being in a workplace
        based on innovation and creativity, acting safely face-to-face with your
        audience, or getting paid to scare the S#!% out of people, send in that
        audition!<br />‍<br />The audition process is really a getting to know
        you event which is based around having fun. You do not need to prepare
        anything for your audition. Just make sure to wear comfortable clothes
        you can move around in, and be ready to have a good time.<br />Nightmare
        Realm is ready to open its doors, are you ready to come inside and
        play?<br />‍<br /><a

        <strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS <br />for Our Team</strong
        ><br /><strong class="bold-text-10"
          ><br />Q: If I don't want to act, do I still need to come to
          auditions?</strong
        ><br />A: Audition day is also for interviews for the other available
        positions, just let us<br />know what position you are applying for and
        we will tailor the interview accordingly.<br /><br /><strong
          class="bold-text-10"
          >Q: What age are you hiring?</strong
        ><br />A: Because of the aspects of the job we can only hire 18 years
        and older. There are <br />restrictions on minors that do not allow them
        to stay as late as we are open during<br />the season. We will still
        bring on minors as volunteers though...<br /><br /><strong
          class="bold-text-10"
          >Q: Volunteers...What is that about?</strong
        ><br />A: This year Nightmare Realm is opening up opportunities for
        volunteer positions.<br />These positions are for minors between the
        ages 16-18, and anyone else who cannot commit<br />for a whole season
        schedule but want to give haunting a try. Although you will not be
        paid,<br />you still get the experience and if you like we will put you
        on an employee first <br />call list for later years.<strong
          class="bold-text-10"
          ><br /><br />Q: What is the pay rate?</strong
        ><br />A: The pay rates are to be determined, but will be above minimum
        wage.<br /><strong class="bold-text-9"
          >‍<br />Q: What do I need to bring to the in-person auditions?</strong
        ><br />A: You will need to bring application info such as Social
        Security number, previous employer information, availability during
        haunt season (please see calendar above for days we will be open), and a
        bottle of water is recommended.<br />‍<br /><strong class="bold-text-8"
          >Q: What should I wear during the audition?</strong
        ><br />A: Wear comfortable clothes and shoes that you can move around in
        during any improv games we may have you take part in.<br />‍<br /><strong
          class="bold-text-7"
          >Q: What will I need to do?</strong
        ><br />A: You will audition by answering questions, doing improv games,
        etc. Additionally we will have you fill out a seasonal calendar with
        your availability to the best of your knowledge, and take a picture to
        add it to your application.<br />‍<br /><strong class="bold-text-6"
          >Q: Do I need prior acting experience?</strong
        ><br />A: It is always helpful to have experience but it is not at all
        necessary. Just a good attitude and a willingness to look silly is all
        you need to audition.<br />‍<br /><strong class="bold-text-4"
          >Q: What is the time commitment if I am hired?<br /></strong
        >A: Call time on haunt days will be 5:30pm until we close that night.
        The calendar you fill out will help us determine the days we will
        contract you to be working. There will also be scheduled training and
        safety days that are mandatory to attend. Please look above again if you
        need to see the calendar for days we will be open in the fall.<br />‍<br /><strong
          class="bold-text-3"
          >Q: What if I can’t be there by 5:30pm?</strong
        ><br />A: Some exceptions including work and school are fine but will
        need to be noted in your contract.<br />‍<br /><strong
          class="bold-text-2"
          >Q: Do I need to attend the training days and acting classes?</strong
        ><br />A: Yes! All training, rehearsal days, and safety meetings prepare
        you for opening day. We take all of this very seriously and want to make
        sure you are prepared! Training days cover all the information you need
        to make sure you, your coworkers, and the audience is safe.<br />‍<br /><span
          ><strong class="bold-text"
            >Q: Will I know that day of my auditions if I have the job?</strong
          ></span
        ><br />A: Not necessarily, we will have call backs and let you know when
        we have made our decisions.<br /><br />‍<br />Any questions not answered
